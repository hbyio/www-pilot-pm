We talked about it in our article on the [editorial calendar ](https://www.pilot.pm/blog/calendrier-editorial/): if you have integrated the publication of content into your overall strategy, it is indispensable.

Pilot's integrated calendar is one of the features most appreciated by our clients.

> What I like about Pilot is that every feature makes sense. Special mention for the calendar search and filtering function"\_ Chloé Larmignat, Content & Social Media Manager at Primagaz

We'll give you a quick tour to show you how to make the best use of the calendars in Pilot!

## Juggling between the different views of the editorial calendar

The calendar displays your various publications by default. It is an editorial calendar through which it is possible to see the production status of your content at a glance.

Here, the display is set to "Publication calendar" + "Display contents".

The title of each content is in the colour of its current status :

As of 9 July, my Linkedin content "The team is on holiday" is in green because it has already been published. On July 23rd, we plan to put a Facebook status online. This one is currently in "To be validated" status.

**To change the calendar display,** just select the desired views in the "Display" section.

Here, we have chosen to also display the **projects** of July.

Finally, you can view the editorial calendar in daily, weekly, monthly or annual views.

## Drag and drop tasks and content

To **change the date on which content should be published**, you can simply **change the editorial calendar**. Simply move the content to another day.

If you have chosen to view the task calendar, it is also possible to change the deadlines by simply dragging and dropping.

## Search and filter contents in the editorial calendar

With an editorial calendar, it is easy to track what has been published during the current month or year. With a spreadsheet, you can search for content via its title.

But what about when you want to **find a content published a long time ago,** and for which you don't remember the details\*\* (title, distribution channel, person in charge ...) ?

Pilot integrates **advanced search and filtering functions** that make life much easier for our customers.

#### Search by key words

Just imagine. You know that 6 months ago you published an article on the theme of bicycles that have marked the history of cycling. You don't remember the title, but you know that the article mentioned a Peugeot bike model from 1975.

So you are going to type "Peugeot" in the search bar.

![](https://pilotapp-leader.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/136/35490/136_35490_working.jpg)

Only content mentioning "Peugeot" will appear. In our example, there is only one, published in January 2020. The title: "The 10 bikes that have marked the history of cycling". It is therefore **not obligatory to mention a keyword contained in the title to find content.**

#### Advanced filters

To **retrieve information**, you have the possibility to use many filters. Thus, you will be able to retrieve :

-   contents

-   distribution channels

-   of the projects

-   tasks

-   of the team members

-   tags, etc...

For each of these elements, several advanced filter options are available:

**Each filtered search can be saved**. For example, if I want to get a list of all the tasks for which the person responsible was Justine, I use the filter "Responsible (Task)". I then save the filter.

A new tab is added next to the main calendar :

You can save as many filters as you need. You can thus create several calendars to help you manage your content strategy.

#### Sharing and exporting filters

Let's take another example. You decide to work with a freelance editor to help you create content for Linkedin.

Among the information presented on your calendar, you would like to share only the Linkedin publications calendar with him.

You will therefore :

-   Create a "Linkedin Publication Content Types" filter

-   Save this filter

-   Click on Actions

-   Choose "share this filter".

When you **share a calendar with an external person**, i.e. who does not have a Pilot account, it is possible to **define a password to secure your data**.

You can also **share a filter with members of your team**. Only the username will be requested.

![](https://pilotapp-leader.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/136/35524/136_35524_working.jpg)

#### Monitoring and export

It is possible to **subscribe to the contents concerned by a filter**. For example, you want to monitor the "Tweets" filter. You will be alerted each time a tweet is added, modified or deleted.

Finally, if you need to process the calendar data on a spreadsheet, the **export in .xlsx format** is possible via the Actions button.
