## Presentation

A channel corresponds to a place where your content will be **broadcast**. You can assign one or more channels to your projects and content.

For example, you can assign one or more channels to your projects and content:

-   A social network: Twitter, Linkedin, Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram ...
-   A podcast
-   A website
-   A newsletter
-   A magazine etc...

## How to create a new channel?

To add a new channel, go to "Channels" from the left menu. Then click on "**New channel**".

You can define one or more **responsibles** for each channel, who will then be able to publish the validated contents on the associated channels.

Tip: thanks to the channels, you can easily classify and retrieve your content after years of production (example: what has been produced, for such and such a channel and for such and such a target in 2015).

## Information architecture

Note that the **channels can be hierarchically arranged** like a site map in order to adapt as closely as possible to the information architecture of your various digital media (website, Intranet, mobile applications, etc.).

It is thus possible to associate each new channel with a parent channel.
