The calendar allows your team to have an overview of the company's speeches over a defined period of time.

## Main calendarÂ 

The main calendar can be accessed directly from the menu on the left. It allows you to see at a glance the production status of the content to be published. Let's take an example:

Here we have a view of the month of June. Each colour corresponds to a particular **production status** (green for contents with a "To be published" status, red for those with a "Draft" status etc.).

The details associated with each content appear by hovering over the title:

## Search and filters

To find items easily, you can use the "search" function to display only those contents that contain this or that keyword.

You can also filter according to a multitude of criteria (e.g.: the person responsible, channels, production status, date of update etc.).

You can save your custom filters. They will then appear in the "Filters" section.
