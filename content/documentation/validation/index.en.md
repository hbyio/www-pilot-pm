Qualify your documents and check their validation

Pilot enables its users to communicate documents to be validated to contacts who do not have an account on the platform.

Very useful to have a text validated by an expert or to receive management approval.

The external contacts can modify the document in real time and the modifications made will be tracked by the internal version management system (which will make it possible to know which modifications have been made by the proofreaders).

Real-time modification of the document avoids the often chaotic management of multiple versions to be merged.

Several validators can simultaneously access and modify the document.

You can also create an external sharing link (read-only mandatory) that will allow you to widely distribute the document to people outside the platform.

## How does it work for the external contact?

A unique link will be sent by email to your contact who will be able to access the content (read-only or read/write depending on your choice).

The external contact will be able to directly modify the document at his/her convenience, leave annotations or do nothing and simply click on "Validate" or "Do not validate" the content (with an optional comment).

The Pilot user who initiated the validation request will be notified as soon as the validation has been carried out.
