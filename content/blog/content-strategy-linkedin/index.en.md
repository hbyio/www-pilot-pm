Linkedin is the platform par excellence to develop its professional network and therefore its commercial activity. You may have already heard these figures: more than 600 million users, 40% of which are active on a daily basis. More than half of the social traffic (https://sumo.com/stories/linkedin-traffic) to B2B sites comes from Linkedin.

If you are not yet present on this network, or if you would like to use it more for your business, here are a few tips:

## Before you start

### Know your audience perfectly 

You will not publish the same content if your ideal customer is an industrial company in the food industry or if you are addressing foodtech startups. The deeper your knowledge of your target audience, the more relevant content you will be able to disseminate. To do this, start by **defining your people**, and list all the issues they face on a daily basis:

-   what are their challenges?

-   Who do they work with?

-   what are their favourite media? ...

### Be clear with your objectives

Knowing why you choose to broadcast this or that content is paramount, and avoids spending time on writing an article that will be "off-topic" for your audience.

You can choose several objectives: lead generation, increase traffic to your site, gain visibility ...

However, be careful : **only one objective per publication** (do not combine a link to your site AND an invitation to receive PDF content in exchange for a comment, for example)

### Determine what types of topics to address 

Following the definition of your personas, you will necessarily go through the step "what are the **contents that would be useful to my audience** ?".

You can start from a main theme, and divide it into sub-themes (Topic Cluster, [Hubspot](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/topic-clusters-seo) devotes a full article to this).

### Define a publication rhythm 

You now know what kind of content to create, for whom, and for what purpose. Like any social network, Linkedin is no exception to the golden rule: regularity.

Your strategy will be much more effective if you publish assiduously. Be careful, this should not be to the detriment of quality: better one good content every week than three not very relevant ones.

There's nothing like an **editorial calendar**, which allows you to plan your content. You will then be able to display :

-   The general theme of the content

-   The title

-   The date of publication

-   The key words

-   Associated sources

Bonus: if several of you are working on content production, setting up a [workflow](https://www.pilot.pm/fr/blog/content-workflow/) will save you precious time.

## In practice

### Personal profile VS company page 

If you have a company page, you may have already asked yourself whether it is better to share your content on it, or on your personal profile.

Your Linkedin profile is your **professional identity card**. It must be complete and honest. Please note that it is not useful to mention all your professional experiences if they are not related to your current field of expertise.

On your profile, you will publish content that increases your credibility gauge. For example, if you are the head of an agency specialising in social networks, you will be able to share a "Top 5 Best Practices on Facebook" with your audience.

**The company page is a showcase for your business**. Its role is more to give an "official" aspect to your company, and to link your company with its employees.

Company pages are less engaging than a personal profile. It is not uncommon to see companies with several thousand subscribers, but with only a dozen or so likes on each publication. Consider your company page as an additional way for your prospects to get in touch with you. It is also the place where you will publish all relevant information about your business: job offers, new products/services, your blog posts etc...

The two are complementary. The tone used on the company page, on the other hand, will be more "corporate" than on the personal profile. To find out more, you can listen to [this episode of the SuperDaily podcast](https://lesuperdaily.com/episode/linkedin-page-entreprise-vs-profil-perso/)

### Types of publication 

It would be a mistake to spam your network with publications that talk about your products/services. Reserve this kind of posts on your company page. In general, focus on **delivering content that brings value to your audience**, for example :

-   advice on a topic in which you are an expert (e.g. I am a salesperson, I can publish tips on how to prospect effectively)

-   tutorials on how to use a tool you enjoy

-   case studies (e.g. "here's how I doubled my conversion rate by restructuring my landing page")

-   blog posts, briefly explaining why you were interested in them

-   Feedback, your opinion on a topical subject (at least one related to the professional world)

You can choose between the following options for the shape:

-   a text publication, perfect for feedback, advice ...

-   a visual publication, which can complement your text: computer graphics, photo, video...

-   an article integrated in Linkedin, for longer publications

-   a PDF document

There is no universal answer to the question "**what type of post for what type of content?**", it depends on your audience's preferences. The simplest way is to test and measure the engagement generated on each of your publications.

### Improving engagement on Linkedin 

The creation of content takes time, which is one of the reasons why the dissemination stage should not be neglected. On average, people who publish content spend **3 times as much time creating it as they do disseminating it**. It should be the other way around! Some tips to improve the engagement of your posts :

-   Mention people in your publication, or as comments, to invite them to share their opinion. Comments tell the algorithm that your content is making your audience react, and its reach will be improved.

-   Be active, and also comment on posts that you find interesting. By regularly interacting with people in your network, you indirectly encourage them to do the same with your content.

-   Involve your team in your social media strategy, propose to your collaborators to share content related to your company.

-   Post at the most relevant time, i.e. the time your target audience is online. An in-depth study of your personas will help you see more clearly.

-   Share your publications in private groups related to your field of expertise.

In conclusion, this advice goes hand in hand with two important aspects: **regularity and patience**. It is by sharing with your network, and building long-term relationships, that the fruits of your involvement will see the light of day!
