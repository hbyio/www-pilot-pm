We don't know why, but this kind of documentary fascinates us. It shows the New York Times production switching from a mechanical process ([Linotype machines](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linotype)) to a digital process.

Every day (!) hundreds of people were able to hand-form the plates that would be used by the presses to print the next day's newspaper. The last adjustments were made directly on the plates.

Impressive production line set to the millimeter and minute, from journalist to press operator.

Copying and pasting" from one page to another was something else at the time (you weren't actually doing it)
